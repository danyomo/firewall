# firewall

## Objective

Mitigate the malware attack by developing a firewall rule

## Description

i simulated the firewallâ€™s scripting language by using an HTTP Server. i can assume this HTTP Server has no computational requirements and has the sole purpose of filtering incoming traffic. i Used Python to develop a firewall rule to mitigate the attack. Develop this rule in python folder and  test my code whilst the firewall HTTP server is running.
